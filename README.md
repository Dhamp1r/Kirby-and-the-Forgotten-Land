I'm ashamed of the quality of the code, but this script does its job of unpacking and packaging the "Filter.bin" file to add all the necessary font characters.

Use "KyrbyFilterTool.py unpack input_file output_folder" on the command line to unpack the file

Use "KyrbyFilterTool.py pack output_folder input_file" on the command line to pack the file
